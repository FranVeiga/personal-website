# About me

I'm Francisco Veiga, a Systems Engineering student from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I started my programming journey during the pandemic, when I got my first
computer of my own for school. Since then, I turned what was a growing interest
into my chosen career path. I'm really passionate about learning and solving
problems, and I am determined to keep improving my skills to become a successful
developer.

**You're invited to take a look around! I'll be posting regularly.** :grin:
